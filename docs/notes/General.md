# General Software installation

Before installing anything in the container make sure that you have all prerequisites for x11 forwarding and having a working and interactive display for the container.
Keep this Container minimal do not install things other than softwares.

## Installing Gimp
Gimp is GNU Image Manipulation Program, which is used to edit images or for me used to draw the software architecture.

## Installing Firefox
Installing firefox in a container is not a necessary setup, but is a good practice to experiment with different thing in the firefox such as different combination of settings.

## Installing OnlyOffice
Installing OnlyOffice via flatpak is hard because it uses a lots of different systemd tools which are not available in a container.
