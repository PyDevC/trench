# General Containers

**General Containers** are standard environments pre-loaded with software that you prefer not to install directly on your **host system**.

Typical examples include applications like **Firefox**, **GIMP**, and other third-party tools. These are **pre-committed** containers designed to be launched when needed and automatically deleted once closed to maintain a clean host environment.
