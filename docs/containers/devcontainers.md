# Dev Containers

**Dev Containers** are development environments created using [devcontainer_podman](https://github.com/PyDevC/devcontainer_podman).

While **Trench** handles the installation of essential tools within these containers, all specific requirements are managed by `devcontainer_podman` or other designated setup repositories.

> A list of available Dev Containers can be found in the [devcontainer_podman](https://github.com/PyDevC/devcontainer_podman) repository.
