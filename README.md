New Depths of System Scripts

## Details
This is the Installation Script for Fedora43. Since Fedora43 is relatively new, I'm going to update it frequently until I switch to a new distro or Fedora44.

Other possibilities for distro hopping could be:

- OpenSUSE
- Arch
- Manjaro
- Ubuntu
- Mint
- CentOS
- RedHat

Right now, Fedora 43 doesn't support many features. I'm either going to leave it or find a workaround until a solution is available. So, don't expect everything to work. It might work for me because my machine might not be up to date.
